    <h5 style="font-size: 150%;">Combat</h5>
    <p>
        This is a work in progress, these sections are to help illucidate systems and concepts that don't have proper in game explination.<br>
        Many of these systems are likely to change drasticly as development continues.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Fight</b>, will allow your monster to decide what to do on the fly.<br>
        This is generally preferable, as they can react to what other monsters do. Healing if they are suddenly hit with a heavy attack, for example.<br>
        George Markus II has a low speed stat, and is more likly to cast Meditate to Heal as his health get's low.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Commands</b>, will open the Commands Menu allowing you to give your monster orders.<br>
        Note: for now your monster is perfectly loyal, I plan to eventually make this not the case.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Attack</b>, will order your monster to try to attack their opponent physically.<br>
        <b>Defend</b>, will order your monster to take a defensive stance, giving them a defensive boost for 1 turn.<br>
        <b>Spells</b>, will open the Spells Menu, letting you order your monster to cast a specific spell.<br>
        <br>
        Normal Attacks deal a random amount of damage up to the maximum calculated below:<br>

        <h6 style="font-size: 100%;">Maximum Attack Damage = (Attacker.EffectiveAttack/2) - (Defender.EffectiveDefence/4)</h6>
        
        Effective attack is: <i>Attack * ( HP/( MaxHP/2 ) )</i><br>
        Effective defence is: <i>Defence * ( HP/( MaxHP/2 ) )</i><br>
        Each monster also has a Luck Stat, when a monster attacks they have a (Luck/1000) chance to score a critical hit, tripling the damage that attack would deal.<br>
        (Note: Minimum Damage roll is normally 0. But on a critical attack, a roll of 0 is increased to 1, before multiplying.)<br>
        <br>
    </p>
    <h5 style="font-size: 150%;">Turn Order / Speed</h5>
    <p>
        Turns are determined by Speed.<br>
        Faster monsters will sometimes get to act multiple times before their oponents get an opportunity to act.<br>
        Currently an arbitrary timeline of 100 points is set. Then each monster takes turns progressing down this time line at their speed value.<br>
        When a Monster reaches or passes 100 points, it retains any excess points as it's sent back to the beginning of the timeline, and get's to take an action.<br>
        <br>
        For example: Monster A has 25 Speed, and Monster B has 20 Speed.<br>
        their turn order will be: A, B, A, B, A, B, A, A, B, repeat.<br>
        <table>

            </tr>
        </table>
        You will have an opportunity to issue your monster new orders each time it takes an action.<br>
        

    </p>
    <h5 style="font-size: 150%;">Magic</h5>
    <p>
        Magic has recieved a substatial buff with the update to Effective Wisdom based on MP. Dealing Double Damage if the user has Full MP.<br>
        This will be balanced out later, when I introduce the 'Magic Contamination' system.<br>
        <br>
        Natural Magic is derived from the Five Pillars (Fire, Earth, Metal, Water, and Wood).<br>
        <b>Fire</b> is the element of consumption and death.<br>
        <b>Earth</b> is the element of stability and growth.<br>
        <b>Metal</b> is the element of division and luck.<br>
        <b>Water</b> is the element of change and adaptability.<br>
        <b>Wood</b> is the element of life and theft.<br>
        <br>
        Spells cost MP to cast. (Some spells also cost HP) If you command your monster to cast a spell that it can't afford, it will waste it's turn trying!<br>
        Outside of battle, your monster will regain MP. Each time you take a step there is a % Chance to regain 1MP, based on how much MP is missing. (MP Missing/MP Maximum)<br>
        <br>
        Spells deal a random amount of damage up to the maximum calculated below:<br>

        <h6 style="font-size: 100%;">Amount = (Caster.EffectiveWisdom/2) - (Target.EffectiveWisdom/8) - (Target.EffectiveDefence/8) </h6>
        
        Effective wisdom is: <i>Wisdom * ( MP/( MaxMP/2 ) )</i><br>
        Most Spells do <i>NOT</i> benefit from critical hits.<br>
    </p>

    <h5 style="font-size: 150%;">Monsters</h5>
    <p>
        For now I have a few stand-in monsters. When I start to develop the Breeding and Phylogeny systems, I'll expand this section.<br>
        <br>

        <b>Giant Rat</b> (Beast)<br>
        A dog sized rat.<br>
        This bulky creature is surprisingly resilient and packs a hefty wallop, though it is slow to act.<br>
        Spells: Meditation, Earth Bolt<br>
        <br>

        <b>Mud Slipper</b> (Aquatic)<br>
        This small fish has the surprising ability to live on land for short periods of time, thanks to a special organ that can store dissolved oxygen.<br>
        What they lack in power, they make up in Smarts and Agility.<br>
        Spells: Water Bolt<br>  
        <br>

        <b>Giant Centipede</b> (Insect)<br>
        This man sized bug with a hundred legs, is well rounded with physical might and magical force.<br>
        Though it's chitin is a bit flimsy, it is very territorial.<br>
        Spells: Void Bolt,<br>
        <br>

        <b>Bed Biter</b> (Insect)<br>
        This insect is about the size of a small cat, and can be as feisty too when backed into a corner.<br>
        It has the potential for strong magics, but doesn't know any spells naturally.<br>
        Spells:<br>
        <br>

        <b>Error Ant</b> (Insect)<br>
        Legends say that when an army ant is separated from it's colony, if it can survive eight years, it will grow to the size of a baby bear and gain the intelligence of small human.<br>
        In reality, the Error Ant was an unfortunate result of a magical experiment turned invasive species.<br>
        Despite their magical origin, they don't possess any spells, but instead have an exceptional strength and a deadly aggression.<br>
        Spells:<br>
        <br>

        <b>Carnivorous Canary</b> (Avian)<br>
        Despite it's name, the Carniverous Canary is not actually a Canary.<br>
        Thanks to convergent evolution, this bird has incidentally evolved to appear almost indistinguishable from canaries.<br>
        These teritorial birds are exceptionally agile, and have a bespoke magic ability to weaponize air. But their frail form means that, <i>if you can hit them</i>, they crumple easily.<br>
        Spells: Air Bolt<br>
        <br>

        <b>Magic Sword</b> (Material)<br>
        It is believed that the emotions of a person are imbued into the tools they use.<br>
        Magic Swords are typically thought to be brought to life from an ancient warrior's angry or regret.<br>
        Though most magic swords are actually carving knives, parring knives, and other such tools.<br>
        Spells:<br>
        <br>

        <b>Orange Ooze</b> (Slime)<br>
        This glob of orange-yellow ooze is actually alive, but lacks an sign of conscious thought.<br>
        Despite it's mindlessness, it still manages to infuse it's Citric Acid with Arcane Fire, flinging off-brand fire bolts at any detected stimuli.<br>
        This ooze is often used as an resource for supplement manufacturing, and like most slimes is also studied for it's inexplicable magic ability.<br>
        Spells: Fire Bolt<br>
