          Hello Again!<br>
          <p>
            I know it's been a while since I've update the Website, but I'm back now!<br>
          </p>
          <p>
            I had a lot of ambitious goals for this year, and I've failed almost all of them!<br>
            This has been a year of changes and I haven' been able to keep a consistent schedule from day to day. And if all is well, I expect to continue having unpredictable days ahead of me for the next several months.<br>
            That brings us to what's the new plan for the rest of the year?<br>
            <b>Streaming:</b> will resume, but not on a set schedule. I've found that I can enjoy playing games when I have an audiance, additionally when I'm streaming I feel much less pressure to play optimally..<br>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Daily Wizards:</b> are cancelled for now. While I do plan on drawing Wizards as much as I can, I know I won't be able to deliver on the "Daily" Aspect.<br>
            I want to give a special Shout out to Angus! the only person on our server to successfully attain the status of Wizard by drawing and Posting a Wizard Every Day for a Year!<br>
            Further, I'm working on a side project to comemorate this, as well as setting up a section on this website to collect all of my Wizards into a single location.<br>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Quartly Films:</b> I already knew this goal was over ambitious. The main issue I have is finding the time between everything else to get recordings and do the editing.<br>
            I've had do issue with ideas and writing though, so I have a lot of ideas I'm looking forward to releasing.<br>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Artisan Monsters:</b> has once again gone on Hiatus. As some of you may know, my day job involves a lot of technical programming and engineering which drains a lot of the type of energy I need to work on games.<br>
            Simply put, I will continue to struggle to work on game dev for as long as I have this job. Moving forward, I'll not be putting game dev on my Road Maps, but rest assured that I will continue to do game dev. Just at a much slower pace.<br>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Sumo:</b> Sumo was a big success! I was able to drive 16 hours to the tournament, got a lot of practice matches in, learned a ton, and lost all of my matches!<br>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>BabsCon:</b> was also a big success! I got to spend time with my best friend and some old friends too!<br>
            We had developed an MLP Version of A Song of Ice and Fire, I had bought and assembled all the piece in the days leading up to the Con and on the first day too!<br>
            There was even a Happy Wedding!<br>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>VidSomewhere:</b> Hasn't happened yet!<br>
            In fact, at the time of writing this, we're about to record the announcement video, so keep an eye out for that in the next few days!

          NEW YEAR, SAME ME!<br>
          <p>
            This has been a particularly hectic year..<br>
            But it’s also been a particularly productive year.<br>
            I learned a lot, and I’ll be taking those lessons into the projects I plan for this year!
          </p>
          <p>
            First of all, I’ll be resuming my <b>Daily Wizards</b> later this month. (I thought I had 1 more week left in December..)<br>
            Last year, I got to 190 Consecutive Daily Wizards. The main issue that tripped me up was not giving the task enough reverence. On multiple occasions, I’d be awake late into the night, putting off the task to the last possible moment.<br>
            I’ll be shifting my schedule slightly to make time in the morning, so I can start my day with a Daily Wizard!
          </p>
          <p>
            As for <b>Artisan Monsters: Alpha</b>, Development on that had gone on Hiatus in July, and I hadn’t found the time to resume development. Ultimately, I felt overwhelmed with the project, and I stopped keeping up with my task list.<br>
            I’m going to spend some time this month developing a better, more concrete plan, and a tighter scope. I plan to also update the Manual Page to make it better outline the game, what’s done, what I’m working on, and what’s next.
          </p>
          <p>
            The last thing I want to touch on is...<br>
            I’m challenging myself to write, film, and release a short film every Quarter.<br>
            The core of this challenge is to keep on a schedule and hit deadlines, not quality. I fully expect this year's films to be awful, but show clear signs of growth.

          <p>
            In 2021 I quit my job to focus on my creative career. I learned quickly that I was not adequately equipped to manage a business.
            A few months later I ended up finding another job as an Assembler in a local Factory, I learned a lot about Manufacturing and Dignity of Work.<br>
            Being the highly motivated person that I am, I quickly rose through the Career Ladder, and applied for a position to work with automation robots as a Technician.<br>
          </p>
          <p>  
            Finding myself now on an Engineering Path, I had to learn a lot of new skills, develop better habits around time management, and learn how to self motivate just to name a few.
            Recently I've started to feel more confident in myself at work, and my home life has started to balance back out.<br>
          </p>
          <p>
            My growth as a creative internet person is still on going, and I hope you can enjoy the journey! (Or at least the content along the way.)
          </p>

            Thank You!<br>
