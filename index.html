     <br> Happy New Year!
      <br> I Quit my Job in November, and started Full Time Content Creation in December. I've never had the freedom to build my own schedule before,
      and a Month into this, I can better reflect on what is working, and what is not working.
      <br> I'm very happy with the progress we've made in Magic Elevator Quest. With the Freedom to schedule my time and energy,
      I've been considerably more diligent with updates! I've also noticed there are a few people that consistantly reply to my posts. I find this to be Fulfilling and Manageable.
      <br>
      <br> The Weekly Devlogs, have also been a huge boon for me. Not only do they help my to stay diligent about working, they also help me to maintain direction,
      plan out my workflow, and keep the scope of my work well managed. Though I don't have a following for my games, I'm making these games for myself, so they are their own reward.
      <br>
      <br> I have struggled to keep up with the Video Uploads. Though I am happy with the videos I've released, I can't help but feel like they could have been better.
      The Monday Deadline, has made me feel more stressed out. and When I miss it, It feels very demotivating. For These reasons, I am not guaranteeing Video Updats on any set schedule.
      <br>
      <br> My work Schedule will remain the same, so I will continue to work on Videos/Animations, but I will now do so without the stress of a Deadline. This will help me to release better video content.
     <br>

     <br> Happy New Year Eve!
      <br> Today is the last day of 2021! Oh well.
      <br> The new Update for EggVenture features all 5 of the Power Ups I plan to build levels around. You can read the <a href="https://bubblegumstudios.itch.io/the-big-eggventure/devlog/330489/week-3-elements" target="_blank">DevLog here.</a> 
      <br> I have a Side Job I'll be busy with this weekend, but I should still have a Video to post on Monday. Maybe not the two videos I hoped to post.

    <br> Merry Christmas!
      <br> Today marks the proper start of Magic Elevator Quest: Chapter 3. I'll be drawing all the new updates in full color!
      <br> I also released the current Outline for EggVenture. Everything I have planned, is in there. Though some areas are TBD, like the bosses and Items, I still feel
      this outline gives a good representation of the core game I envision.
      <br> I was able to impliment Wall Climbing, and have it adjust movement directions based on camera facing and angle of the wall the egg is on.
      By next Friday, I'll have the remaining Four Boons implimented, and I'll get a basic Settings menu made that will allow you to toggle the boons on or off.
      <br> As for Monday's Video, I'm not sure If I'm going to get something finished by then or not. I've been quite busy preparing for the Holidays..
      <br> In the Worst Case, I'll have two Videos the following Monday to make up for it!

     <br> Hello!
      <br> Yet another Animatic out! I'm starting to get a feel for the flow of working on these, but it's still feels like a daunting task..
      Next Monday will be another live action video, I haven't quite settled on an Idea yet, though..
      <br> Again, the Source Files for the Bone Heist animatics will be released all in one big batch at the end.
      <br> Friday, I'll be releasing a new Devlog outlining the basic flow I plan for EggVenture. Though this does mean I probably wont have a Game Update
      ready to release, I'll have something substantial for the next DevLog after.

    <br> Happy Friday!
      <br> Today, is the newest update for EggVenture! You can checkout the <a href="https://bubblegumstudios.itch.io/the-big-eggventure/devlog/325704/week-1-tutorial" target="_blank">DevLog</a> to see what's new, or <a href="https://bubblegumstudios.itch.io/the-big-eggventure" target="_blank">Play the Game</a> directly.
      <br> In other news, I plan on releaseing a new animatic on Monday. I got a lot of good feedback on the last one, so I've reduced my scope and worked slower on this one,
      so that I can focus on things like keeping characters properly scaled, varying my type of shots, and making better use of notes.
      <br> I would like to alternate between animations and live action videos, as the Live action videos take much less time to produce,
      this will give me more time to work on animations, develop EggVenture, and keep up with Magic Elevator Quest updates! While I have plenty of material I want to animate,
      I don't have many ideas for live action videos yet.

    <br> Another Week, Another Video! I didn't have anything coordinated properly, so I ended up having to do all my recording Saturday and Sunday. 
     Then stay up late to finish the editing. Even then, I had some extra work to finish this morning before I was satisfied with the Final Video.
     As made Evident in the Video, I play Old School Runescape, my name is ArtisanHuman! I'm not on very often, buy I'm always happy to hangout or help,
     just Ping ArtisanBubblegum on the <a href="https://discord.gg/V782kvCh9h" target="_blank">Discord Server!</a>
     <br> I also play RPG MO, Path of Exile, Book of Travels, and Monster Hunter Rise, about as frequently as I do OSRS.
     <br> This Friday, I'll have a basic Tutorial level built for EggVenture. And I hope to find a way to make the wall jumping feel more satisfying by then too.

    <br> It's been over a week since I quit my job to make content fulltime. I made a 3 minute animatic, and resumed Magic Elevator Quest.
      I'll admit, I wasn't working as Diligently as I intended, but I've sorted out a more concrete work schedule. You can Expect 
      2 to 5 Updates on Magic Elevator Quest every weekday. And I'll have a Devlog ready for "The Big EggVenture", on Friday the 10th.
     <br>
     <br> I should be able to comfortably fund this endevor through March 2022. By then, I may have to look into returning to the workforce.
      This will of course put all active projects on Indefinite Hiatus.
     <br>
     <br> Any Support is greatly Apreciated! Even a Sub on Youtube, or Joining the Discord Server!

    26th November 2021:
      <p id="archiveP"> As of December 6th 2021, the new Schedule will be put into place!
       <br> <b>Comic Updates:</b> Monday - Friday
       <br> <b>New Videos:</b> Every Monday
       <br> <b>Dev Logs:</b> Every Friday
      <br> This new schedule is possible because of the iminent end to my current employment. there is however another side effect of the end
      of my current employment, a lack of income. Not to worry though, I have built up a small savings and plan to live off of this 
      for as long as possible. Luckily, my lifestyle is exceptionaly CHEAP! at as little as $300/month, I can cover all my basic needs.
      Of course, my savings wont last forever, in time I may have to put my work back on hiatus to seek gainful employment once again. If you enjoy 
      the content that I produce, and would like to see it improve without interuption, you can support me through the links above! Be it a Sub on Youtube, a Follow on Itch.io,
      or joining the Dawnsomewhere Discord. Building a community is the first step in continuing our creative works.
