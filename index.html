          Hello!<br>
          <p>
            It's a new year and we've got a new paradigm!<br>
          </p>
          <p>
            First off I'd like to announce that a new Artisan has joined the family! I've been calling her Lady and won't be sharing her government name.<br>
            We have a rough start to life and had to go to the NICU to help her get started, we then learned that the NICU isn't just a place for sick babies to get better, it's also a place where healthy babies get stuck forever..<br>
            The Artisan-Wife and I finally lost our patience and started asking some pointed questions, one of the docotors ended up admitting that that we could do outpatient for our duaghter. So we talked to the Social Worker and tolder how we felt. (Rare + for Social Workers!)<br>
            After which the discussions went from "We'll see how she's doing next week" to "We're getting you ready for discharge today."<br>
            We're now Home, Happy, and Healthy. <br>
          </p>
          <p>
            Last Year was a year of realizations.<br>
            I realized that while I have the best job I could ever home to have, I'm still miserable. (My current theory is that I am incapable of tolerating employment.)<br>
            I realized how little capacity I really have, and how hard I've been pushing my body over these years.<br>
            Overall, I can see that the employed season of my life is coming to an end, by my wife isn't on board with the transition. Which is entirly reasonable!<br>
            I want to jump ship from a great job with great benefits, to persue a nebulous "Creative Career", and my only 'proof' of success is my unusually fast growth on Twitch.<br>
            But on the other hand, this will allow me to work at home, giving me the freedom/flexibility to support my family at a more personal level.<br>
            I'm praying that my wife will see what I've been shown, but until I can get confirmation from her, I can't shake the boat.<br>
          </p>
          <p>
            What does that mean for 2026?<br>
            In this new year, I will continue to work on projects as much as I can. But I will be placing Family as a higher priority.<br>
            While I expect the frequency of my work to drop this year, I expect the quality of my work to continue to improve.<br>
            Over the next few weeks, My family and I will be settling into a new routine. I expect that I will be able to make a tenative schedule by the end of this month (January).<br>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Streaming:</b> will resume, but I won't have a schedule in place until Febuary (at the soonest).<br>
            The OSRS Marathon Stream in cancelled, as I can't see me being able to secure a large enough block of time for this in the near future.<br>
            We will be moving forward into Ape Escape! on the PS1, followed by Shadow of Collossus.<br>
            As for the JP Spyro Speedruns, the First Stream of each week will be a Speedrun to ensure I'm still getting my practice in.<br>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Daily Wizards:</b> are always on my mind. I've been chomping at the bit to get started, but with the recent Holiday season, and now the new baby, I've been unable to comit to daily uploads..<br>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Quartly Films:</b> are no longer on a schedule. I have a few videos recorded, and a few in the writing stage.<br>
            I can work on writing and editting between taking care of Lady, but I won't really have time to do more recording.<br>
            So there will be a few new videos to catch this year, and I'll think about releaseing some scripts..<br>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Artisan Monsters:</b> I am working on writing out a design document and a player's manual.<br>
            I don't expect to be able to work on any large updates this year.<br>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>DawnSomewhere Events:</b> I expect that these will continue as normal this year. Aside from BabsCon which no longer exists.<br>
            The More demanding events are later in the year when I'll have found a better routine with my family, so I don't anticipate a conflict.<br>
            <p style="width: 80%; margin: auto">
              <b>+ Weekly OSRS Clan Events:</b> Every Saturdy at 3pm PST, I host events in OSRS for my clan "Ransomewhere".<br>
            </p>
            <p style="width: 80%; margin: auto">
              <b>+ Artisan's Monthly Open Table:</b> On the last Saturday of Each Month, I run an Open Table on the Discord Server to introduce new people to Role Playing as opposed to Roll Playing.<br>
            </p>
            <p style="width: 80%; margin: auto">
              <b>+ VidSomewhere:</b> Once a Year we host an online Film Festival where Effort is more important that Quality.<br>
            </p>
            <p style="width: 80%; margin: auto">
              <b>+ Also:</b> We have a couple other amazing community members that run other events on our server!<br>

          <p>
            In 2021 I quit my job to focus on my creative career. I learned quickly that I was not adequately equipped to manage a business.
            A few months later I ended up finding another job as an Assembler in a local Factory, I learned a lot about Manufacturing and Dignity of Work.<br>
            Being the highly motivated person that I am, I quickly rose through the Career Ladder, and applied for a position to work with automation robots as a Technician.<br>
          </p>
          <p>  
            Finding myself now on an Engineering Path, I had to learn a lot of new skills, develop better habits around time management, and learn how to self motivate just to name a few.
            Recently I've started to feel more confident in myself at work, and my home life has started to balance back out.<br>
          </p>
          <p>
            My growth as a creative internet person is still on going, and I hope you can enjoy the journey! (Or at least the content along the way.)
          </p>
          <p style="text-indent: 4%;">
            Thank You!<br>
