          <p>
            Almost 2 Years ago I quit my job to focus on my creative career. I learned quickly that I was not adequately equipped to manage a business.
            A few months later I ended up finding another job as an Assembler, I learned a lot about Manufacturing and Dignity of Work.<br>
            Being the highly motivated person that I am, I quickly rose through the Assembler Career Ladder, and applied for a position to work with robots as a Technician.<br>
          </p>
          <p>  
            Finding myself now on an Engineering Path, I had to learn a lot of new skills, develop better habits around time management, and learn how to self motivate just to name a few.
            Recently I've started to feel more confident in myself at work, and my home life has started to balance back out. So I made the new years resolution to Write, Draw, and Publish a comic book!<br>
          </p>
          <p>
            After planning out the Sword Wizard Comic Project and starting work on the Artisan Monsters Game Project, I felt a lot more productive and spent a lot less time 'brainstorming'. 
            The skills I learned (And continue to learn) in Manufacturing apply surprisingly well to the Creative Process!<br>
            <br>
          </p>
          <p>
            In short, the past 2 years has been an exciting journey of discovery and growth. I have a lot left to learn from my workplace, and I'm excited to see how I can bring those lessons back to my creative pursuits.<br>
          </p>
          <p style="text-indent: 4%;">
            Thank You!<br>
