      <h3>2024 Roadmap:</h3>
      <img src="/Roadmap-2024.png" width="70%"></img><br>

      <b>September Update:</b>
      <div style="text-align: center;">
        <div style="display: inline-block; text-align: left; text-indent: 2%; max-width: 700px;">
          It's been a while since I've updated the website.. SORRY!<br>
          <p>
            The <b>Vidsomewhere</b> was a Huge Success! We had some new and returning participants, and we were almost overwhelmed with the quantity of submissions this year!.<br>
            <iframe style="display: block; margin: auto;" width="500" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HUIvC36vVbA?si=jE5mtdUyRYl7FUuk" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><br>
            I'm looking forward to what we can do next year!
          </p>
          <p>
            As for the <b>Sword Wizard</b> Project, this is placed onto indefinite hold.<br>
            I had written and rewritten some rough drafts, but none felt good enough. I've taken some time to reflect and Overall, I feel like I need to develope my narrative skills on smaller projects first.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Artisan Monsters</b> is still under development, but I am extending the deadline to Q4 of 2025.<br>
            I could rush through and spaghettie my way through development to get ver 1 done by the end of the year.<br>
            Instead, I'm electing slow down development to allow me to better balance the stress of programming against my other life obligations.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally, I have a <b>Wizard Avatar</b> that I'm developing for VRChat.<br>
            Using OBS and the VRCs built in recording features, I can digitize myself into various environments. I'm hopful that I can start making short films soon!

          <p>
            Almost 2 Years ago I quit my job to focus on my creative career. I learned quickly that I was not adequately equipped to manage a business.
            A few months later I ended up finding another job as an Assembler, I learned a lot about Manufacturing and Dignity of Work.<br>
            Being the highly motivated person that I am, I quickly rose through the Assembler Career Ladder, and applied for a position to work with robots as a Technician.<br>
          </p>
          <p>  
            Finding myself now on an Engineering Path, I had to learn a lot of new skills, develop better habits around time management, and learn how to self motivate just to name a few.
            Recently I've started to feel more confident in myself at work, and my home life has started to balance back out.<br>
          </p>
          <p>
            My growth as a creative internet person is still on going, and I hope you can enjoy the journey! (Or at least the content along the way.)
          </p>
