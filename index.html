     <br> Hello!
      <br> Yet another Animatic out! I'm starting to get a feel for the flow of working on these, but it's still feels like a daunting task..
      Next Monday will be another live action video, I haven't quite settled on an Idea yet, though..
      <br> Again, the Source Files for the Bone Heist animatics will be released all in one big batch at the end.
      <br> Friday, I'll be releasing a new Devlog outlining the basic flow I plan for EggVenture. Though this does mean I probably wont have a Game Update
      ready to release, I'll have something substantial for the next DevLog after.

    <br> Happy Friday!
      <br> Today, is the newest update for EggVenture! You can checkout the <a href="https://bubblegumstudios.itch.io/the-big-eggventure/devlog/325704/week-1-tutorial" target="_blank">DevLog</a> to see what's new, or <a href="https://bubblegumstudios.itch.io/the-big-eggventure" target="_blank">Play the Game</a> directly.
      <br> In other news, I plan on releaseing a new animatic on Monday. I got a lot of good feedback on the last one, so I've reduced my scope and worked slower on this one,
      so that I can focus on things like keeping characters properly scaled, varying my type of shots, and making better use of notes.
      <br> I would like to alternate between animations and live action videos, as the Live action videos take much less time to produce,
      this will give me more time to work on animations, develop EggVenture, and keep up with Magic Elevator Quest updates! While I have plenty of material I want to animate,
      I don't have many ideas for live action videos yet.

    <br> Another Week, Another Video! I didn't have anything coordinated properly, so I ended up having to do all my recording Saturday and Sunday. 
     Then stay up late to finish the editing. Even then, I had some extra work to finish this morning before I was satisfied with the Final Video.
     As made Evident in the Video, I play Old School Runescape, my name is ArtisanHuman! I'm not on very often, buy I'm always happy to hangout or help,
     just Ping ArtisanBubblegum on the <a href="https://discord.gg/V782kvCh9h" target="_blank">Discord Server!</a>
     <br> I also play RPG MO, Path of Exile, Book of Travels, and Monster Hunter Rise, about as frequently as I do OSRS.
     <br> This Friday, I'll have a basic Tutorial level built for EggVenture. And I hope to find a way to make the wall jumping feel more satisfying by then too.

    <br> It's been over a week since I quit my job to make content fulltime. I made a 3 minute animatic, and resumed Magic Elevator Quest.
      I'll admit, I wasn't working as Diligently as I intended, but I've sorted out a more concrete work schedule. You can Expect 
      2 to 5 Updates on Magic Elevator Quest every weekday. And I'll have a Devlog ready for "The Big EggVenture", on Friday the 10th.
     <br>
     <br> I should be able to comfortably fund this endevor through March 2022. By then, I may have to look into returning to the workforce.
      This will of course put all active projects on Indefinite Hiatus.
     <br>
     <br> Any Support is greatly Apreciated! Even a Sub on Youtube, or Joining the Discord Server!

    26th November 2021:
      <p id="archiveP"> As of December 6th 2021, the new Schedule will be put into place!
       <br> <b>Comic Updates:</b> Monday - Friday
       <br> <b>New Videos:</b> Every Monday
       <br> <b>Dev Logs:</b> Every Friday
      <br> This new schedule is possible because of the iminent end to my current employment. there is however another side effect of the end
      of my current employment, a lack of income. Not to worry though, I have built up a small savings and plan to live off of this 
      for as long as possible. Luckily, my lifestyle is exceptionaly CHEAP! at as little as $300/month, I can cover all my basic needs.
      Of course, my savings wont last forever, in time I may have to put my work back on hiatus to seek gainful employment once again. If you enjoy 
      the content that I produce, and would like to see it improve without interuption, you can support me through the links above! Be it a Sub on Youtube, a Follow on Itch.io,
      or joining the Dawnsomewhere Discord. Building a community is the first step in continuing our creative works.
