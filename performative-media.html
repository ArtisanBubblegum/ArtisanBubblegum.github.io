    <h3>Discord</h3>
    I don't have a discord server of my own, but I do owe a lot of my creative drive to DawnSomewhere.<br>
    Feel free to join the <a href="https://discord.gg/4qw5qYBrYy" target="_blank">DawnSomewhere Discord</a>.<br>
    Though many of the original creative types have moved on, I still feel like there's potential in this community.<br>    
    <h3>Twitch</h3>
    This section is a Placeholder for when I'm ready to start streaming.<br>
    <h3>Other</h3>
    I feel like there should be a third section on this page, as the other pages have Three Sections,<br>
    This section is to make the site feel more balanced.<br>
